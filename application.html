    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Step into the world of Tile Match, where strategy, focus, and quick thinking come together to create the ultimate puzzle experience! This game isn’t just about matching tiles—it’s about mastering the challenge of clearing the board before you run out of space.

        Your goal is simple yet thrilling: match 3 identical tiles to remove them from play. But there’s a twist—some tiles are locked beneath others, and you’ll need to clear the top layers first before accessing them. Every move matters, and with only 7 slots available, filling them up with unmatched tiles means GAME OVER!

        Think ahead, strategize your matches, and experience the satisfaction of clearing the board. With increasing difficulty, exciting tile designs, and a test of your puzzle-solving skills, Tile Match promises hours of addictive fun!

    <div class="steps-content">
        <p1>Selecting Tiles: Tap on a tile to move it into your selection space at the bottom of the screen. You can hold up to 7 tiles at a time, so choose wisely!</p1>
        <p1>Making Matches: Once you collect three identical tiles, they will automatically disappear, freeing up space for new selections. The key is to plan ahead—if your selection space fills up with 7 unmatched tiles, the game is over!</p1>
        <p1>Unlocking Hidden Tiles:  Not all tiles are immediately available! Some are stacked beneath others, and you’ll need to clear the top layers first to access them. This means thinking a few moves ahead and being mindful of which tiles you pick first.</p1>
        <p1>Winning the Game: Your goal is to match and clear all the tiles on the board without filling up your selection space. As the levels progress, the patterns become trickier, and you’ll need to use strategy, memory, and logic to succeed!</p1>
