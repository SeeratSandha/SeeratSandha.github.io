        <p>Selecting Tiles: Tap on a tile to move it into your selection space at the bottom of the screen. You can hold up to 7 tiles at a time, so choose wisely!</p>
        <p>Making Matches: Once you collect three identical tiles, they will automatically disappear, freeing up space for new selections. The key is to plan ahead‚Äîif your selection space fills up with 7 unmatched tiles, the game is over!</p>
        <p>Unlocking Hidden Tiles:  Not all tiles are immediately available! Some are stacked beneath others, and you‚Äôll need to clear the top layers first to access them. This means thinking a few moves ahead and being mindful of which tiles you pick first.</p>
        <p>Winning the Game: Your goal is to match and clear all the tiles on the board without filling up your selection space. As the levels progress, the patterns become trickier, and you‚Äôll need to use strategy, memory, and logic to succeed!</p>
