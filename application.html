    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Step into the world of Tile Match, where strategy, focus, and quick thinking come together to create the ultimate puzzle experience! This game isn’t just about matching tiles—it’s about mastering the challenge of clearing the board before you run out of space.

        Your goal is simple yet thrilling: match 3 identical tiles to remove them from play. But there’s a twist—some tiles are locked beneath others, and you’ll need to clear the top layers first before accessing them. Every move matters, and with only 7 slots available, filling them up with unmatched tiles means GAME OVER!

        Think ahead, strategize your matches, and experience the satisfaction of clearing the board. With increasing difficulty, exciting tile designs, and a test of your puzzle-solving skills, Tile Match promises hours of addictive fun!
