    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>Tile Match is a fun and engaging puzzle game where you need to match 3 identical tiles to clear them. 
       Some tiles are locked beneath others, and you must free them by clearing the ones on top first. 
       You have a space for 7 tiles—fill it with different tiles, and you lose! 
       The challenge is to strategize and match wisely.</p>

    <h2>How to Play</h2>
    <p>To play Tile Match, simply tap on a tile to move it to your selection space. 
       When you collect three matching tiles, they disappear, creating more room. 
       Be careful! If all 7 slots are filled with different tiles, you lose. 
       Use strategy to clear the board and win the game!</p>
