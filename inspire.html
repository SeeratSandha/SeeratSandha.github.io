<h2>What makes him a Hero?</h2>
<p>The Most Feared Warrior Who Beat The Afghans. Known as the "most feared Sikh warrior," Hari Singh Nalwa was a renowned Sikh leader who once brought order to the chaotic troops in Afghanistan.</p>
<p>Afghanistan was a land that even Alexander suffered to step in. It is said that, whenever Alexander went to invade a country, he used to send a letter to his mother, and before the letter reached his mother, he would have won over the land. But when he came to Afghanistan, he failed to do so. And his mother inquired about the delay in acquiring it. In reply to her letter, he sent her some soil that belonged to the land and told her to spread it across the house. After doing so, many of their loyal soldiers or houseguards refused their loyalty towards them. With this example, it is said that AFGHANISTAN is a land of cruelty and betrayal.</p>
